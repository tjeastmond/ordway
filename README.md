# Ordway Assessment

I built out the algorithm to find and return the best seats available for a given venue. I wrote the solution in JavaScript/Node. Due to time constraints I have not had tha chance to work on the bonus section of this assessment yet. I will find time to do so if requested.

## Setup & Running

Running this script will require Node and NPM being installed. I wrote some unit tests that will require `Jest`. You can install and run it with the following:

```sh
> npm ci
> npm test
```

I have an additional file, `src/app.js`, that just makes some seat requests and console logs the results. You can run it from the root directory with:

```sh
> node src/app
```
